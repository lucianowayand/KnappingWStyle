# Knapping with Style

A exploration modpack with custom recipes centered around joining Terrafirmacraft and Create Mod, with improvement of life features and automation.

## Mod list:
To make somethings work and to make the whole experience better altogether i added some TFC and Create addons and they are:

* Create Sifting
* Create Jetpacks
* Firmalife
* TFC Homestead
* TFC Item Barrels

## Planned features:
Some ideas came up while i was working on the integrations, and ill be working on them in the near future. You are free to send more ideas on the comments or on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Y2DFfHApkC) server.

### Automating Firmalife and TFC Foods
All foods from create were disabled because messing with nutrition looks like a lot of work, so now the objective is to make the same automations but with the TFC Foods.
