Its used on a big number of recipes, all of them necessary for your progression.$(br2)To make Galvanized steel you will need to progress in the game at least until you have a steady supply of zinc and iron.",
        "As Galvanized Steel is not an alloy it can't be melted back, zinc has a melting point much lower than iron or steel and it would boil away before the iron or steel could melt.$(br2)However it can be welded and made into sheets.",
